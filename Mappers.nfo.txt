This document is dedicated to Vertigo 2099, the greatest ROM releasing
group on the net, of which I am a proud member. And Jim Geffre, the author
of PCNES and GBE. Thanks for all the help.

****************************************************************************
Why did I write this? There just isn't any other good and widely available
documentation on the "extended" mappers (16 and above). FanWen's documents
(on which the extended mapper section is largely based) are an excellent
source of information, but I discovered several errors in them, and more
importantly, they are quite hard to obtain. Goroh's documents, released
more recently, are easier to get and fairly accurate, but the Japanese and
broken English text can make reading through them an ordeal.
I also wanted to combine the several documents I had on MMC1 into one
comprehensive source. Any mapper information not given here is appreciated.
I cannot guarantee that all this information is 100% accurate. What I can
guarantee is that I have put in the maximum possible amount of effort to
get this document as accurate as possible. If you notice a mistake,
please tell me about it, and I'll give you credit for the fix.
I hope it doesn't take me a year to update it again...

                regarding mapper #21 and the ambiguities in the .NES format.
                Mapper numbers are listed for the exotic mappers, although
                these may change with the standardization of the format.
                Many new mapper descriptions added.

                   À--------------------------------------------------------Ù

 Notes: - When the cart is first started, the first 16K ROM bank in the cart
           is loaded into $8000, and the LAST 16K bank into $C000. Normally,
           the first 16K bank is swapped via register 3 and the last bank
           remains "hard-wired". However, bit 2 of register 0 can change
           this. If it's clear, then the first 16K bank is "hard-wired" to
           bank zero, and the last bank is swapped via register 3. Bit 3
           of register 0 will override either of these states, and allow
           the whole 32K to be swapped.
        - MMC1 ports are only one bit. Therefore, a value will be written
           into these registers one bit at a time. Values aren't used until
           the entire 5-bit array is filled. This buffering can be reset
           by writing bit 7 of the register. Note that MMC1 only has one
           5-bit array for this data, not a separate one for each register.

 Notes: - When the cart is first started, the first 16K ROM bank in the cart
           is loaded into $8000, and the LAST 16K ROM bank is loaded into
           $C000. This last 16K bank is permanently "hard-wired" to $C000,
           and it cannot be swapped.
        - This mapper has no provisions for VROM; therefore, all carts
           using it have 8K of VRAM at PPU $0000.
        - Most carts with this mapper are 128K. A few, mostly Japanese
           carts, such as Final Fantasy 2 and Dragon Quest 3, are 256K.
        - Overall, this is one of the easiest mappers to implement in
           a NES emulator.

                     À----------------------------------------------Ù

 Notes: - The ROM size is either 16K or 32K and is not switchable. It is
           loaded in the same manner as a NROM game; in other words,
           it's loaded at $8000 if it's a 32K ROM size, and at $C000 if
           it's a 16K ROM size. (This is because a 6502 CPU requires
           several vectors to be at $FFFA - $FFFF, and therefore ROM needs
           to be there at all times.)
        - The first 8K VROM bank is swapped into PPU $0000 when the cart
           is reset.
        - This is probably the simplest memory mapper and can easily be
           incorporated into a NES emulator.

 Notes: - Two of the 8K ROM banks in the PRG area are switchable.
           The other two are "hard-wired" to the last two banks in
           the cart. The default setting is switchable banks at
           $8000 and $A000, with banks 0 and 1 being swapped in
           at reset. Through bit 6 of $8000, the hard-wiring can
           be made to affect $8000 and $E000 instead of $C000 and
           $E000. The switchable banks, whatever their addresses,
           can be swapped through commands 6 and 7.
        - A cart will first write the command and base select number
           to $8000, then the value to be used to $8001.
        - On carts with VROM, the first 8K of VROM is swapped into
           PPU $0000 on reset. On carts without VROM, as always, there
           is 8K of VRAM at PPU $0000.

 Notes: - Much of this information is incomplete and possibly inaccurate.
        - To learn about MMC5's EXRAM system, read Y0SHi's NESTECH
           document. Note that Castlevania 3 doesn't use EXRAM but
           the Koei games (Bandit Kings of Ancient China, Gemfire, etc.)
           do use it.
         - On reset, all ROM banks are set to the LAST 8K bank in the
            cartridge. The last 8K of this is "hard-wired" and cannot
            be swapped. (As far as I know.)
         - MMC5 has its own sound chip, which is only used in Japanese
            games. I do not know how it works.

 Notes: - The first 32K ROM bank is swapped into $8000 when the cart is
           started or reset.
        - This mapper has no provisions for VROM; therefore, all carts
           using it have 8K of VRAM at PPU $0000.
        - Many carts using this mapper need precise NES timing to work
           properly. If you're writing an emulator, be sure that you have
           provisions for switching screens during refresh, and be sure the
           one-screen mirroring is emulated properly. Also make sure that
           you have provisions for palette changes in midframe and for
           special handling of mid-HBlank writes to $2006.

 Notes: - When the cart is first started, the first 16K ROM bank in the cart
           is loaded into $8000, and the SECOND 16K ROM bank is loaded into
           $C000. This 16K bank is permanently "hard-wired" to $C000, and it
           cannot be swapped.
        - The first 8K VROM bank is swapped into PPU $0000 when the cart is
           reset.
        - I do not know if all 5 bits of the PRG switcher are used.
           Possibly only three or four are used.
        - Not many games use this mapper, but it's easy to implement, so
           you might as well add it if you're writing a NES emulator.

 Notes: - When the cart is first started, the first 8K ROM bank in the cart
           is loaded into $8000, and the LAST 3 8K ROM banks are loaded into
           $A000. These last 8K banks are permanently "hard-wired" to $A000,
           and cannot be swapped.
        - The "latch selector" in question can be swapped by access to PPU
           memory. If PPU $0FD0-$0FDF or $1FD0-$1FDF is accessed, the latch
           selector is $FD. If $0FE0-$0FEF or $1FE0-$1FEF is accessed, the
           latch selector is changed to $FE. These settings take effect
           immediately. The latch contains $FE on reset.

 Notes: - When the cart is first started, the first 16K ROM bank in the cart
           is loaded into $8000, and the LAST 16K ROM bank is loaded into
           $C000. This last 16K bank is permanently "hard-wired" to $C000,
           and cannot be swapped.
        - The "latches" can be swapped by access to PPU memory. If PPU
           $0FD0-$0FDF is accessed, latch #1 becomes $FD. If $0FE0-$0FEF
           is accessed, it becomes $FE. Latch #2 works in the same manner,
           except the addresses are $1FD0-$1FDF and $1FE0-$1FEF for $FD
           and $FE respectively. These bank switch settings take effect
           immediately. Latches contain $FE on reset.

 Notes: - When the cart is first started, the first 16K ROM bank in the cart
           is loaded into $8000, and the LAST 16K ROM bank is loaded into
           $C000. This last 16K bank is permanently "hard-wired" to $C000,
           and it cannot be swapped.
        - VROM should NOT be swapped into PPU $0000 when the cartridge is
           started or reset, in order to avoid graphics corruption.
        - The IRQ counter is decremented at each scanline if active and set
           off when it reaches zero. An IRQ interrupt is executed at that
           point.

 Notes: - When the cart is first started, the first 16K ROM bank in the cart
           is loaded into $8000, and the LAST 16K ROM bank is loaded into
           $C000.
        - To use the ROM and VROM switching registers, first write the low
           4 bits of the intended value into the first register, then the
           high 4 bits into the second register. For example, to swap 1K
           VROM bank $B8 to PPU $0400, you'd write $0B into $A003 and $08 to
           $A002. I think that some cartridges do it the other way around,
           writing the low nybble first.
        - VROM should NOT be swapped into PPU $0000 when the cartridge is
           started or reset, in order to avoid graphics corruption.
        - The IRQ counter is decremented at each scanline. When it reaches
           zero, an IRQ interrupt is executed.
        - This information is untested! I do not have any mapper 18 ROM
           images, unfortunately.

           $C000. The last 8K of ROM is permanently "hard-wired" and cannot
           be swapped.
        - The LAST 8K of VROM is swapped into PPU $0000 on reset, if it
           is present.
        - The IRQ counter is incremented at each scanline. When it reaches
           $7FFF, an IRQ interrupt is executed, but there is no reset.
           This is still preliminary and untested, and I may be wrong on
           this point. Splatterhouse and several other games run fine
           without it.
        - The Namcot 106 mapper supports one or more additional sound
           channels. BioNES supports these. I have no clue how they work.
        - Thanks to Mark Knibbs for correcting several misconceptions about
           this mapper that were included in 0.70.

 Notes: - When the cart is first started, the first 16K ROM bank in the cart
           is loaded into $8000, and the LAST 16K ROM bank is loaded into
           $C000. The last 8K of ROM is permanently "hard-wired" and cannot
           be swapped.
        - VROM should NOT be swapped into PPU $0000 when the cartridge is
           started or reset, in order to avoid graphics corruption.
        - To use the VROM switching registers, first write the low
           4 bits of the intended value into the first register, then the
           high 4 bits into the second register. For example, to swap 1K
           VROM bank $B8 to PPU $0800, you'd write $0B into $C002 and $08 to
           $C000. I think that some cartridges do it the other way around,
           writing the low nybble first. Note that this is actually two
           different varieties of mapper combined into one. Gradius 2
           uses the pairs 0-2 and 1-3. Other games (i.e. Wai Wai World 2)
           use the pairs 0-2 and 4-6. In the .NES format these two are
           "shoe-horned" together. fwNES refers to the Gradius 2 style
           as mapper #25 and the Wai Wai World 2 style as mapper #21.
           Marat's standard lists both as #21.
        - The IRQ counter is incremented each 113.75 cycles, which is
           equivalent to one scanline. Unlike a real scanline counter, this
           "scanline-emulated" counter apparently continues to run during
           VBlank. When the IRQ counter value reaches $FF, IRQ's will be
           set off, and the counter is reset.

 Notes: - When the cart is first started, the first 16K ROM bank in the cart
           is loaded into $8000, and the LAST 16K ROM bank is loaded into
           $C000. The last 16K of ROM is permanently "hard-wired" and cannot
           be swapped.
        - On reset, the first 8K of VROM is swapped into PPU $0000.

 Notes: - When the cart is first started, the first 16K ROM bank in the cart
           is loaded into $8000, and the LAST 16K ROM bank is loaded into
           $C000. The last 8K of ROM is permanently "hard-wired" and cannot
           be swapped.
        - VROM should NOT be swapped into PPU $0000 when the cartridge is
           started or reset, in order to avoid graphics corruption.
        - To use the VROM switching registers, first write the low
           4 bits of the intended value into the first register, then the
           high 4 bits into the second register. For example, to swap 1K
           VROM bank $B8 to PPU $0800, you'd write $0B into $C001 and $08 to
           $C000. I think that some cartridges do it the other way around,
           writing the low nybble first.

 Notes: - When the cart is first started, the first 16K ROM bank in the cart
           is loaded into $8000, and the LAST 16K ROM bank is loaded into
           $C000. The last 8K of ROM is permanently "hard-wired" and cannot
           be swapped.
        - VROM should NOT be swapped into PPU $0000 when the cartridge is
           started or reset, in order to avoid graphics corruption.
        - The IRQ counter is incremented each 113.75 cycles, which is
           equivalent to one scanline. Unlike a real scanline counter, this
           "scanline-emulated" counter apparently continues to run during
           VBlank. When the IRQ counter value reaches $FF, IRQ's will be
           set off, and the counter is reset.
        - There are more registers which I don't understand the usage of
           and which are not detailed here. There's also a custom sound chip,
           the operation of which is unknown to me. As always, any extra
           information is welcome.

 Notes: - When the cart is first started, the first 16K ROM bank in the cart
           is loaded into $8000, and the LAST 16K ROM bank is loaded into
           $C000. The last 8K of ROM is permanently "hard-wired" and cannot
           be swapped.
        - VROM should NOT be swapped into PPU $0000 when the cartridge is
           started or reset, in order to avoid graphics corruption.

 Notes: - The first 32K ROM bank is swapped into $8000 when the cart is
           started or reset.
        - Carts without VROM (i.e. Deadly Towers) will have 8K of VRAM
           at PPU $0000. Carts with VROM (Impossible Mission 2) have the
           first 8K swapped in at reset. Apparently, this mapper is actually
           a combination of two actual separate mappers. Deadly Towers uses
           only the $8000-$FFFF switching, and Impossible Mission 2 uses
           only the three lower registers.
        - This mapper is fairly easy to implement in a NES emulator.

 Notes: - Two of the 8K ROM banks in the PRG area are switchable.
           The last page is "hard-wired" to the last 8K bank in
           the cart.
        - At reset, all four 8K banks are set to the last 8K bank
           in the cart.
        - A cart will first write the command and base select number
           to $8000, then the value to be used to $8001.
        - On carts with VROM, the first 8K of VROM is swapped into
           PPU $0000 on reset. On carts without VROM, as always, there
           is 8K of VRAM at PPU $0000.

 Notes: - When the cart is first started, the first 16K ROM bank in the cart
           is loaded into $8000, and the LAST 16K ROM bank is loaded into
           $C000. The last 8K of ROM is permanently "hard-wired" and cannot
           be swapped.
        - VROM should NOT be swapped into PPU $0000 when the cartridge is
           started or reset, in order to avoid graphics corruption.
        - Does anyone have info on mirroring or IRQ's for this mapper?

             À----------------------------------------------Ù

 Notes: - The last 8K ROM page is permanently "hard-wired" to the last 8K
           ROM page in the cart.
        - This mapper is deployed in a manner similar to that of MMC3. First
           a register number is written to $8000 and then the register
           chosen can be accessed via $A000.
        - Command #8 works in the following manner. The upper 2 bits select
           what is swapped into $6000-$7FFF. If bit 6 is 0, it will be
           ROM, selected from the other bits of the register. If it's 1,
           then the contents depend on bit 7. In this case, if bit 7 is
           1, it will be WRAM. If it's 0, it will be pseudo-random numbers
           (this still hasn't been figured out).

           is loaded into $8000, and the LAST 16K ROM bank is loaded into
           $C000. This last 16K bank is permanently "hard-wired" to $C000,
           and it cannot be swapped, as far as is known.
        - This mapper has no provisions for VROM; therefore, all carts
           using it have 8K of VRAM at PPU $0000.
        - Many ROMs from these games are incorrectly defined as mapper #2.
           Marat has still not assigned an "official" .NES mapper number
           for this mapper.

 Notes: - When the cart is first started, the LAST 16K ROM bank in the cart
           is loaded into both $8000 and $C000. The 16K at $C000 is
           permanently "hard-wired" to $C000 and cannot be swapped.
        - Vertical mirroring is always active.
        - Some of the registers can be accessed from other addresses than
           those listed above. For example, $7000 can also be accessed
           from $7002, $7004, and so on through $7FFA. $7001 can be accessed
           at $7003, $7005, and so on through $7FFB. Similar rules apparently
           are in force for the registers at $6000-$6FFF.
        - This mapper supports IRQ interrupts. I have no clue how.

           |                                  it's mirrored at both $8000
           |                                  and $A000. Whether the top

                                              1 - Horizontal mirroring

 Notes: - This mapper is interesting in that the address written,
           rather than the value, controls the switching. A15-A00 is
           simply the address written in binary notation. For example,
           writing to $A3C7 (1010001111000111 in binary) would select
           horizontal mirroring, 32K PRG bank #7, and 8K CHR bank
           #7. Note that only writes to $8000 and above are valid.
        - Vertical mirroring is probably set at powerup.
        - At reset, the first 32K ROM bank is swapped into $8000,
           and the first 8K VROM bank is swapped into PPU $0000.
        - Thanks to Mark Knibbs for hacking this mapper.

 Notes: - This mapper is interesting in that the address written,
           rather than the value, controls the switching. A15-A00 is
           simply the address written in binary notation. For example,
           writing to $A3C7 (1010001111000111 in binary) would select
           horizontal mirroring, 32K PRG bank #7, and 8K CHR bank
           #7. Note that only writes to $8000 and above are valid.
        - Registers can also be accessed at several other values:
           register #0, for example, is also found at $5804, $5808,
           and so on through $5FFC. The same mirroring is true with
           the other registers.
        - Vertical mirroring is probably set at powerup.
        - At reset, the first 32K ROM bank is swapped into $8000,
           and the first 8K VROM bank is swapped into PPU $0000.
           Registers 0 and 2 contain the value 15 ($0F) and registers
           1 and 3 contain a value of zero.
        - Thanks to Mark Knibbs for hacking this mapper.
